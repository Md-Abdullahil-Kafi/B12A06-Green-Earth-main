### 1) Difference between var, let, and const  
- **var** is the old way of declaring variables, it is function-scoped and can be redeclared.  
- **let** is block-scoped, cannot be redeclared in the same block, but its value can be changed.  
- **const** is also block-scoped, but once a value is assigned it cannot be reassigned.

### 2) Difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()  
- **map()** creates a new array with the results of applying a function to each element.  
- **forEach()** runs a function on each element but does not return a new array.  
- **filter()** creates a new array with elements that pass a specific condition.

### 3) Arrow functions in ES6  
Arrow functions are a shorter way to write functions in ES6. They do not have their own `this` and are often used to make the code simpler and cleaner.

### 4) Destructuring assignment in ES6  
Destructuring assignment allows you to take values from arrays or properties from objects and store them into variables directly in a simple way.

### 5) Template literals in ES6  
Template literals are a new way of writing strings in ES6. They allow you to easily add variables and write multi-line strings. Unlike string concatenation, they make the code easier to read and manage.
